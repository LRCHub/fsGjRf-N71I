I used to cry, I used to cry tonight
But that was all before you came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now you're here, it's not the same, it's not the same

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're the man, I need

And in the evening when the moon is high
I'll takes you down and rock me slow, yeah
And in the morning when I kiss your eyes
I hold you close and won't let go, I won't let go, no

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all the woman, I need

You know something, you're the most beautiful lady in the world
I love you

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're the man I need

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fill me, baby, baby

You fill me up
(You give me love) give me love
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're the man I need
