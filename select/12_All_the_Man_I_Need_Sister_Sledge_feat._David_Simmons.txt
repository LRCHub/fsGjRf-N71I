i used to cry i used to cry each night, but that was all before he came, i thought love had to hurt to turn out right but now you'
re here it'
s not the same, it'
s not the same, you fill me up you give me love, more love than i'
ve ever seen, you'
ve all i'
ve got, you'
re all i'
ve got in this world but you'
re all the man i need.
and in the evening when the moon is high, i'
ll take you down and rock you slow and in the morning when i kiss your eyes, i'
ll hold you close and won'
t let go, i won'
t let go.
you fill me up, you give me love, more love than i'
ve ever seen, you'
re all i'
ve got you'
re all i'
ve got in this world, but you'
re all i need.
you fill me up, you give me love, more love than i'
ve ever seen, you'
re all i'
ve got, you'
re all i'
ve got in this world but you'
re all the love i need.
